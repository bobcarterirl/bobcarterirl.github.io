title: HSL 1.1.7 â€“ Array Zero Size
---

This post is part of a series. If you're new, see the intro post and table of contents, [here][IntroPost].

C-style arrays with zero elements are non-standard. This means that our `array` class can't contain the normal underlying array, if it wouldn't have any elements. We'll make sure of this by creating a class with all the properties of a C-style array, but without any elements. We'll call this class `Empty_array`. Our first task will be to change the declaration of `arr`, so that it becomes an `Empty_array` whenever `N == 0`. We can do this simply, using [`std::conditional`][StdConditional], or rather, its helper type `std::conditional_t`.

In `array.hpp`:

```cpp
template<typename T, size_t N>
class array
{
    // ...
    // Under member types (we'll need them later)
private:
    class Empty_array
    {
    };

    using Array = conditional_t<N, T[N], Empty_array>;

public:
    Array arr;
    // ...
};
```

Remember to create an aliase for `std::conditional_t`.

## Pointer decay ##

The first feature of C-style arrays we need to emulate is pointer decay. This will enable our `data` member function to work, as well as `operator[]`, `at`, and whatever other functions that use the subscript operator on `arr`. The way to do this is with a [conversion function][UserDefinedConversion]. It should be `constexpr`, so that it can be used in our `constexpr` member functions.

In `array.hpp`:

```cpp
template<typename T, size_t N>
class array
{
    // ...
private:
    class Empty_array
    {
    public:
        constexpr operator pointer()
        {
            return nullptr;
        }
    };
};
```

There's no particular reason it has to return `nullptr` -- we could cast `this` to `T*` if we wanted to -- but `nullptr` works just fine.


## begin, end ##

The second (and last, actually) feature we have to emulate is the ability to use the iterator functions `hsl::begin`, `hsl::end`, and their `const` and `reverse` comrades. Just like we did with our main `array` class, we can make these work by writing `begin`, `end`, etc. member functions. In fact, we don't have to write all of them: `cbegin` calls the `const` overload of `begin`, and so on with the other ones that begin with 'c'. Just like the pointer conversion, we want `begin` and `end` to return `nullptr`.

In `array.hpp`:

```cpp
template<typename T, size_t N>
class array
{
    // ...
private:
    class Empty_array
    {
    public:
        // ...
        // Under conversion function
        constexpr iterator begin() noexcept { return nullptr; }
        constexpr const_iterator begin() const noexcept { return nullptr; }

        constexpr iterator end() noexcept { return nullptr; }
        constexpr const_iterator end() const noexcept { return nullptr; }
        // ...
    };
};
```

## rbegin, rend ##

`rbegin` and `rend` are almost identical. The only difference is that we need to construct a `reverse_iterator` from `nullptr` and return that.

In `array.hpp`:

```cpp
template<typename T, size_t N>
class array
{
    // ...
private:
    class Empty_array
    {
    public:
        // Under end
        constexpr reverse_iterator rbegin() noexcept
        {
            return reverse_iterator(nullptr);
        }

        constexpr const_reverse_iterator rbegin() const noexcept
        {
            return const_reverse_iterator(nullptr);
        }

        constexpr reverse_iterator rend() noexcept
        {
            return reverse_iterator(nullptr);
        }

        constexpr const_reverse_iterator rend() const noexcept
        {
            return const_reverse_iterator(nullptr);
        }
    };
};
```

## empty ##

We're almost done. There's just one thing left to do. As you'll recall, we wrote the `empty` member function to always return `false`. At the time, I mentioned that it should really be implemented as `return !N;`, so let's just quickly change it.

In `array.hpp`:

```cpp
template<typename T, size_t N>
class array
{
public:
    // ...
    constexpr bool empty() const noexcept { return !N; }
};
```

And that's it! Next time, we'll move on to a new container, probably `vector`.
